<h1>History</h1>
<hr>
<p>I was born on December, 5th, 2003 in Taiwan, Hsinchu.
I lived in a apartment and had a sister who was about 2 years older than me.
When I was 6 my family and I moved to America. I then quickly picked up on english and during second grade, changed schools 2 times.
I then had a lot of fun making friends and developing my interests, I went on many different field where I learned a lot about many different subjects.
Then after I had graduated from elementary school I went to middle school and learned what it meant to be a student.</p>
